				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			
				<details>
					<summary>Do we accept walk-ins?</summary>
					<p>Yes, we welcome walk-ins. However, priority will be given to those with prior bookings. We recommend that you book in advance using our <a href="booking.html">online booking system</a> to avoid disappointment.</p>
				</details>
			
				<details>
					<summary>How long does BIAB/acrylics last?</summary>
					<p>Typically, it lasts between 2-3 weeks before needing an infill or removal. The longevity depends on several factors such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Nail growth rate</li>
						<li>Daily activities such as typing and cleaning, which may cause chipping or lifting</li>
						<li>Nail care – avoid harsh chemicals like bleach and keep your nails dry</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
			
				<details>
					<summary>What is the difference between normal polish and shellac/gel polish?</summary>
					<p>Normal polish is applied in layers (base coat, color, and top coat) and air-dries. Shellac/gel requires curing under a UV or LED lamp after each layer for instant drying. Normal polish lasts 2-5 days without chipping, whereas shellac/gel lasts around 2-3 weeks without chipping or peeling.</p>
				</details>
			
				<details>
					<summary>Is BIAB better than acrylics?</summary>
					<p>It depends on what you’re looking for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For durability, acrylics are better as BIAB is strong but more flexible, leading to possible chipping or lifting.</li>
						<li>BIAB has a more natural and softer feel, while acrylics are harder and heavier.</li>
						<li>BIAB allows your natural nails to strengthen and grow, while acrylics allow for long extensions and bold designs.</li>
						<li>If you use your hands a lot, acrylics might be more advisable.</li>
					</ul>
				</details>
			
				<details>
					<summary>What is your removal process?</summary>
					<p>For both BIAB and acrylics, we file them off. While we can use acetone to soak off BIAB, it is time-consuming and may dry out your nails. We take great care to avoid damaging your natural nails.</p>
				</details>
			
				<details>
					<summary>Can I remove my nails at home?</summary>
					<p>We do not advise removing your own nails at home, as it may leave your nails more damaged. Visit our salon for a professional removal to save your natural nails.</p>
